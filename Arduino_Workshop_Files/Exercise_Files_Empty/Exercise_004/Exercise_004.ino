/*
*  Arduino Workshop
 * Exercise_004
*  Fading while moving
 *  
*  At the end of this exercise, we should have 3 LEDs fading continuously
 * without any interruption. Also, with two buttons, user must be able to
*  select which LED to fade.
 *  
*  Key Requirements
 * 1. Use interrupts for button input.
*  2. Use timer interrupt to fade LED.
 * 3. Only one LED should be fading at a time.
*  4. When shifting LED, previous LED must set itself to
 * maximum brightness.
*  5. At the beginning, led_1 should be fading.
 * 6. Fading interval is 50ms, with fading amount of 5.
*  7. At the end, loop() function should be empty.
 *  
*  Hints
 * 1. Buttons uses pull-up resistors. (Digital Input/Output)
*  2. Remember external interrupt pins? (Button Control)
 * 3. Remember minimum and maximum PWM value? (Fading)
*  4. Remember timer masking? (Multi-Tasking)
 * 
*  Do not alter given variables! Only add/remove/modify custom variables!
