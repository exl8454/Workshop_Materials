*  Previous sketch showed state machine using millis(), but in order to check if it was time to do
 * a task, we had to call millis() every loop.
* 
 * This time, instead of checking the time for each loop, we will use internal interrupt
*  so the microcontroller will call a specific method.
 * 
*  Atmega328P has 3 timers; Timer0, Timer1, and Timer2. Timer0 is used to call millis()
 * function in Arduino, so Timer0 is what we want to use to interrupt.
